            <h3><a name="1" class="1"></a>What conditions are treated by chiropractors?</h3>
            <p>Doctors of Chiropractic (DCs) care for patients of all ages, with a variety of health
                conditions. DCs are especially well known for their expertise in caring for patients with
                back pain, neck pain and headaches...particularly with their highly skilled manipulations
                or chiropractic adjustments. They also care for patients with a wide range of injuries and
                disorders of the musculoskeletal system, involving the muscles, ligaments and joints.
                These painful conditions often involve or impact the nervous system, which can cause
                referred pain and dysfunction distant to the region of injury. The benefits of chiropractic
                care extend to general health issues, as well, since our body structure affects our overall
                function. DCs also counsel patients on diet, nutrition, exercise, healthy habits, and
                occupational and lifestyle modification.</p>
            <h3 class="top"><a name="2" class="2"></a>Does treatment require a referral from an MD?</h3>

            <p>A referral is usually not needed to see a doctor of chiropractic (DC); however, your health
                plan may have specific referral requirements. You may want to contact your employer's
                human resources department—or the insurance plan directly—to find out if there are any
                referral requirements. Most plans allow you to just call and schedule an appointment with a DC.</p>
            <h3 class="top"><a name="3" class="3"></a>Is chiropractic treatment safe?</h3>

            <p>Chiropractic is widely recognized as one of the safest drug-free, non-invasive therapies
                available for the treatment of neuromusculoskeletal complaints. Although chiropractic has
                an excellent safety record, no health treatment is completely free of potential adverse
                effects. The risks associated with chiropractic, however, are very small. Many patients
                feel immediate relief following chiropractic treatment, but some may experience mild
                soreness or aching, just as they do after some forms of exercise. Current literature shows
                that minor discomfort or soreness following spinal manipulation typically fades within 24 hours.

                Neck pain and some types of headaches are treated through precise cervical
                manipulation. Cervical manipulation, often called a neck adjustment, works to improve
                joint mobility in the neck, restoring range of motion and reducing muscle spasm, which
                helps relieve pressure and tension. Neck manipulation is a remarkably safe procedure.
                While some reports have associated upper high-velocity neck manipulation with a certain
                kind of stroke, or vertebral artery dissection, recent evidence suggests that this type of
                arterial injury often takes place spontaneously, or following everyday activities such as
                turning the head while driving, swimming, or having a shampoo in a hair salon. Patients
                with this condition may experience neck pain and headache that leads them to seek
                professional care—often at the office of a doctor of chiropractic or family physician—but
                that care is not the cause of the injury. The best evidence indicates that the incidence of
                artery injuries associated with high-velocity upper neck manipulation is extremely rare
                – about 1 case in 5.85 million manipulations.

                If you are visiting your doctor of chiropractic with upper-neck pain or headache, be very
                specific about your symptoms. This will help your doctor of chiropractic offer the safest
                and most effective treatment, even if it involves referral to another health care provider.
                It is important for patients to understand the risks associated with some of the most
                common treatments for musculoskeletal pain -- prescription and over-the-counter
                nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) -- as these treatments may carry risks
                significantly greater than those of chiropractic manipulation. According to a study
                from the American Journal of Gastroenterology, approximately one-third of all hospitalizations
                and deaths related to gastrointestinal bleeding can be attributed to the use of aspirin or NSAID painkillers like ibuprofen.</p>
            <h3 class="top"><a name="4" class="4"></a>Is chiropractic treatment appropriate for children?</h3>
            <p>Yes, children can benefit from chiropractic care.
                Children are very physically active and
                experience many types of falls and blows from
                activities of daily living as well as from participating in sports. Injuries such as these may cause many symptoms including back and
                neck pain, stiffness, soreness or discomfort. Chiropractic care is always adapted to the
                individual patient. It is a highly skilled treatment, and in the case of children, very gentle.</p>
            <h3 class="top"><a name="5" class="5"></a>Are chiropractors allowed to practice in hospitals or use medical outpatient facilities?</h3>
            <p>Chiropractors are being recognized to admit and treat patients in hospitals and to use
                outpatient clinical facilities (such as labs, x-rays, etc.) for their non-hospitalized patients.
                Hospital privileges were first granted in 1983.</p>
            <h3 class="top"><a name="6" class="6"></a>Do insurance plans cover chiropractic?</h3>

            <p>Yes. Chiropractic care is included in most health insurance plans, including major medical
                plans, workers' compensation, Medicare, some Medicaid plans, and Blue Cross Blue Shield
                plans for federal employees, among others. Chiropractic care is also available to active-duty
                members of the armed forces at more than 60 military bases and is available to veterans
                at 36 major veterans medical facilities.</p>
            <h3 class="top"><a name="7" class="7"></a>What type of education and training do chiropractors have?</h3>
            <p>Doctors of chiropractic are educated as primary-contact health care providers, with an
                emphasis on diagnosis and treatment of conditions related to the musculoskeletal system
                (the muscles, ligaments and joints of the spine and extremities) and the nerves that
                supply them. Educational requirements for doctors of chiropractic are among the most
                stringent of any of the health care professions.

                The typical applicant for chiropractic college has already acquired nearly four years of
                pre-medical undergraduate college education, including courses in biology, inorganic and
                organic chemistry, physics, psychology and related lab work. Once accepted into an
                accredited chiropractic college, the requirements become even more demanding — four
                to five academic years of professional study are the standard. Doctors of chiropractic are
                educated in orthopedics, neurology, physiology, human anatomy, clinical diagnosis including laboratory procedures, diagnostic imaging, exercise, nutrition rehabilitation and more.

                Because chiropractic care includes highly skilled manipulation/adjusting techniques,
                a significant portion of time is spent in clinical technique training to master these
                important manipulative procedures. In total, the chiropractic college curriculum includes
                a minimum of 4,200 hours of classroom, laboratory and clinical experience. The course
                of study is approved by an accrediting agency that is fully recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.</p>
            <h3 class="top"><a name="8" class="8"></a>How is a chiropractic adjustment performed?</h3>
            <p>Chiropractic adjustment or manipulation is a manual procedure that utilizes the highly
                refined skills developed during the doctor of chiropractic's intensive years of chiropractic
                education. The chiropractic physician typically uses his or her hands--or an instrument--to
                manipulate the joints of the body, particularly the spine, in order to restore or enhance
                joint function. This often helps resolve joint inflammation and reduces the patient's pain.
                Chiropractic manipulation is a highly controlled procedure that rarely causes discomfort.
                The chiropractor adapts the procedure to meet the specific needs of each patient.
                Patients often note positive changes in their symptoms immediately following treatment.</p>
            <h3 class="top"><a name="9" class="9"></a>Is chiropractic treatment ongoing?</h3>

            <p>The hands-on nature of the chiropractic treatment is essentially what requires patients to
                visit the chiropractor a number of times. To be treated by a chiropractor, a patient needs to
                be in his or her office. In contrast, a course of treatment from  medical doctors often
                involves a pre-established plan that is conducted at home (i.e. taking a course of antibiotics
                once a day for a couple of weeks). A chiropractor may provide acute, chronic, and/or
                preventive care thus making a certain number of visits sometimes necessary. Your doctor of
                chiropractic should tell you the extent of treatment recommended and how long you can expect it to last.</p>
            <h3 class="top"><a name="10" class="10"></a>Why is there a popping sound when a joint is adjusted?</h3>
            <p>Adjustment (or manipulation) of a joint may result in the release of a gas bubble between
                the joints, which makes a popping sound. The same thing occurs when you "crack" your
                knuckles. The noise is caused by the change of pressure within the joint, which results in gas
                bubbles being released. There is usually minimal, if any, discomfort involved.</p>
